## Introduction
This program is a Python script that utilizes the Selenium web driver and the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library to scrape a specified number of tweets containing a particular keyword from Twitter and a specified number of posts from a subreddit on Reddit. The scraped data is stored in an Excel file that can be easily accessed and analyzed.
